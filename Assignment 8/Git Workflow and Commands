✅ 1. Stage All Changes and Commit with a Message

git add .
git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message" 

  
✅ 2. Move Commits to the Correct Branch
(You committed to the wrong branch by mistake)

# Step 1: Checkout the correct branch
git checkout correct-branch

# Step 2: Cherry-pick the commits from the wrong branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash1> <commit-hash2> ...

# Step 3 (Optional): Remove commits from the wrong branch
git checkout wrong-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~N  # N = number of commits to remove



✅ 3. Create a New Branch, Commit Changes, and Push

git checkout -b new-branch-name        # Create and switch to new branch
# Make your code changes
git add .                              # Stage changes
git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"        # Commit
git push origin new-branch-name        # Push to GitHub


✅ 4. Contribute to an Open-Source Project on GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Fork the repo on GitHub
# Step 2: Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git

# Step 3: Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Step 4: Make changes, commit, and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Added feature XYZ"
git push origin feature-branch

# Step 5: Open a Pull Request on GitHub from feature-branch → main branch of original repo

  
✅ 5. Resolve Merge Conflicts

# Step 1: Merge main into your branch
git checkout your-branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Step 2: Git will show conflict files — open and fix them manually

# Step 3: After resolving conflicts
git add .
git commit                             # Confirms merge


✅ 6. Create a Feature Branch from Latest Main

git checkout main
git pull origin main                   # Ensure main is up to date
git checkout -b feature-branch

  
✅ 7. Revert to a Specific Commit, Discarding Newer Commits

git reset --hard <commit-hash>         # Danger: Removes all commits after the specified one
git push origin branch-name --force    # Push forced update to remote (if needed)

  
✅ 8. Restore a Deleted File Committed by Mistake

# Step 1: Find the commit before deletion
git log --diff-filter=D --summary

# Step 2: Restore the file
git checkout HEAD~1 -- path/to/file

# Step 3: Add and commit it again
git add path/to/file
git commit -m "Restore accidentally deleted file"
